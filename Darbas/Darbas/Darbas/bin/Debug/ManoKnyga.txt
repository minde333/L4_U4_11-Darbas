We live in an age when we have forgotten And so, as you start this book, forgotten
I respectfully ask you,
who will cry when you die? 
How many and what life is all about neighbor.
We can easily put a person on the Moon, but we have neighbor 
trouble walking and across the street to meet a new neighbor.
We can fire a missile. Across the, world with pinpoint.lives will you touch while
you have the privilege and to walk this planet connected?
What impact digital will your life have on the generations that follow you? 
And what legacy will you leave behind after you have taken your last breath?
