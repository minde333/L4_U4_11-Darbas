And so, as you start this book, forgotten
I respectfully ask you,
who will cry when you die? 
How many lives will you touch while
you have the privilege and to walk this planet connected?
What impact digital will your life have on the generations that follow you? 
And what legacy will you leave behind after you have taken your last breath?
